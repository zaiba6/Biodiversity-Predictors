The inshore area sampled includes four1 depth strata: 5-20 fathoms.21-35 fathoms. 36-55 fathoms. and >56 fathoms out to approximately the 12-mile limit.and five longitudinal regions based on oceanographic. geologic. and biological features(Figure 1). Together. 20 separate strata exist.With the addition of the fourth strata. the total survey area increased from ~3.626 nauticalmiles (NM2) to ~4.665 NM2. To keep sampling density of the original strata roughlyequivalent with previous surveys. an additional 15 stations were added to the originalgoal of 100 stations per survey. A target of 115 stations is selected for sampling in eachsurvey resulting in a sampling density of 1 station for every 40 NM2. Number of towsper stratum is apportioned according to its total area (Tables 1 and 2).SELECTION OF RANDOM STATIONSRandom stations are selected from a NOAA nautical chart in Arc ViewTM GIS overlainwith 1-NM2 grids. Each grid within each region is assigned a unique identificationnumber that serves as a call number. Grids are selected using an ExcelTM random numbergenerator. Tows approximately 1 NM long are proposed in each grid and plotted in PSeaWindplotTM (using charts of the NAD 1983 datum). From prior experience and localknowledge. some grids are classified as untowable during the plotting process. Due tothe large amount of fixed gear and the appeal to fishermen to cooperate with the surveyby clearing the tows. identifying good tow locations is a priority. If no towable bottomcan be found within a 2-mile radius. a new random number is chosen within the samestratum. Beginning and end points of each tow are identified in P-Sea Windplot. To theextent possible. for ease of identification by lobster industry members. tows follow loranlines. Loran C coordinates are converted to latitude/longitude degrees to the nearest0.001 decimal minutes.2SELECTION OF FIXED STATIONSAfter the initial survey in the fall of 2000. two stations per stratum were designated asfixed stations to be sampled on each subsequent survey. In areas where previous workhad been done. the stations were selected due to their historical importance3. In areas withno history. one station was selected as being roughly representative of the average catchfor its respective stratum and the other was randomly selected. After the addition of thefourth stratum in the spring of 2003. fixed stations were designated for that stratum usingthe same criteria.FISHING GEARTrawl design considerations for the survey include effectiveness of the gear forsampling the complex bottom in the nearshore areas of the Gulf of Maine andcomparability with previous and ongoing surveys by NMFS and MassachusettsDivision of Marine Fisheries. The net is a modified version of the shrimp netdesign used in Maine waters (Appendix A). designed to fish for a variety of nearbottomdwelling species without targeting any specific component. RobertTetrault. the vessels? owner. and net designer Jeff Flagg designed the net to fishfeet in length with nominal horsepower. Three identical nets were constructed forthis survey in the event of tearing or loss. Net tapers were cut to permit the shapeof the net to get maximum height while allowing the net to remain tight on thebottom. The net is shackled from the footrope to the frame with two 3/8th inchshackles to a banded wire that runs parallel with the footrope. Heavy rubber wingbobbins retard bottom wing lift at the net end of the bottom leg. Top legs are7/16th wire. 60 feet in length with soft eyes at each end. and bottom legs are 5/8thinch wire. 58 feet in length with two feet of 5/8th inch chain at the end where theleg attaches to the bottom wing for a total of 60 feet. Bottom legs are coveredwith 2 -3/8? cookies to prevent them from digging into the mud. The net isconstructed of 2-inch #24 polyethylene mesh. with a 1-inch (stretched measure)mesh liner in the cod end. Otter boards are #7.5 Bisons. Attached to the 70-foot.5/8th inch Rander?s Combination Wire Rope footrope is a roller frame strung onto?? IPS of 6x19 construction with a fiber core. The ten-foot wide bosom section ismade up of eight-inch rubber discs on six-inch centers along with eight evenlyspaced toggles. Spacing is maintained by smaller four-inch cookies strungbetween the discs. The two 29-foot wing sections are made up of six-inch rubberdiscs spaced 4 ? inches apart. with the same four inch cookies used to maintainspacing. Each wing section contains twelve toggles spaced evenly to facilitatefootrope attachment. The 5/8? Rander?s combination rope headrope has twentyeight8? center-hole. deep-sea net floats strung with 5/8? yellow polyethylenefloat line. Between surveys. the net is sent back to the manufacturer where it isreturned to specification (Appendix B). Nets will be replaced as they age to keepthe gear in good working condition and insure consistency.

Geographic Coverage: The Scheldt (Dutch Schelde French Escaut) is a 350 km long river in northern France western Belgium and the southwestern part of the Netherlands. Its name is derived from an adjective corresponding to Old English sceald shallow Modern English shoal Low German schol Frisian skol and Swedish sk?ll thin. Bounding Coordinates:  50.58 51.51 / 2.81 4.58 (min max Latitude / min max Longitude)   Taxonomic Coverage: All species in this dataset are fishes (Actinopterygii Cephalaspidomorphi) except for the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) which is an invasive arthropod and the common littoral crab (Carcinus maenas). The top 3 recorded species are Rutilus rutilus (27%) Gobio gobio (10%) and Anguilla anguilla (7%).         Sampling Methods: The three sampling methods that were applied in this project (cooling water intertidal and subtidal fykes) proved to be complementary and each are useful to describe a different aspect of the migration of diadromous fishes. The volunteer network (intertidal fykes) has a high temporal and spatial resolution. Especially the catadromous species that use the estuary as a foraging and nursery area were caught in the intertidal fyke nets. Subadult shads and downstream migrating juvenile lampreys were only caught in the cooling water of the powerplant of Doel. In addition the fish monitoring of the cooling water in Doel started in 1991 which allows us to investigate long-term trends. The subtidal fyke nets that were deployed underneath the migration barriers proved to be efficient in catching the fishes during their spawning run. During their upstream migration anadromous fishes accumulate underneath the barriers where they can be caught in large numbers. migration of diadromous fishes data from the river Scheldt Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Sites,140,,"1.

Both plants are situated on the northern coast of Taiwan(Fig. 1). The average generating capacity and the combined water flow velocity of the first plant is4.680 J and 69 m3 s _ 1. and those of the second plant is 7.056 J and 80 m3 s _ 1. There was no change inoperation that can result in significant changes in the pumped volume. so the combined water flow wasconstant over years. However. each generator was shut down for maintenance in turn for about onemonth during winter to spring seasons. which causes the combined water flow velocity to decrease 50%.The sample was collected in opportune days in order to avoid sampling during the maintenance period.Over 6.000.000 m3 of water. taken from the near-shore waters off northeastern Taiwan. was used monthlyby these two nuclear power plants.The intake of the first plant was built on a straighter shoreline than that of the second plant. which islocated in an open bay along the Yehliu Cape.

UPC data are collected at 80 points uniformly positioned within a 1 m wide area centered along each 40 m transect (Figure 1). A diver records all organisms intersecting an imaginary vertical line passing through each point and species percent cover is determined as the fraction of points a species intercepts x 100. A species is only recorded once at a given point even if it intersects the imaginary line multiple times. Using this technique the percent cover of all species combined on a transect can exceed 100%. but the percent cover of any individual species cannot.

Surveys were conducted between 04:30 and 08:00 EDT and most were completed by 06:30 EDT. Observers listened quietly for ten minutes at each of five stations. [In 2003 we increased the 5-species point count length from five to ten minutes in order to gather more information and to achieve methodological consistency with the all-species protocols and with Canada?s High-Elevation Landbird Program.]They recorded the number of each focal species seen or heard during three time periods: 0-3 minutes 3-5 minutes and 5-10 minutes. If Bicknell?s Thrush was not detected during or between point counts surveyors returned to each point immediately after the full route survey and broadcast a one-minute recording of the bird?s vocalizations in order to elicit a response from present but silent birds. A two-minute listening period followed each broadcast. [Prior to 2003 the broadcast duration was three minutes.]Audio playbacks were discontinued upon detection of one or more individuals. If no Bicknell?s Thrush responded to the broadcasts the status of the species at that location was classified as unknown. Monitors who completed their surveys without encountering Bicknell?sThrush were asked to conduct follow-up audio playback surveys at dusk or dawn before 15 July (after Atwood et al. 1996). If no observations of Bicknell?s Thrush were made during the second visit the species was presumed to be absent from that site. Site selection was based on a GIS model of potential Bicknell?s Thrush habitat that incorporates elevation. latitude. and forest type (see Lambert et al. 2005). The model depicts conifer-dominated forests above an elevation threshold that drops 81.63 m for every one-degree increase in latitude (-81.63 m/1? latitude). The threshold?s slope corresponds closely with the latitude-elevation relationship for treeline in the Appalachian Mountain chain. which is -83 m/1? latitude (Cogbill and White 1991). Four routes have been established on peaks lying below the elevation threshold. while forty routes cross the threshold due to the limited availability of trails or land area above the threshold. We made an attempt to randomize site selection by randomly assigning priority ranks to discrete units of high-elevation habitat. However. the choice of sites was constrained by the availability of volunteers and the location of existing trails. When placing routes. we favored discrete starting points (e.g. trail junction). extensive conifer stands. and upper elevations. Volunteers establishing a route for the first time placed five points at 200- to 250-m intervals along a mapped course. Monitors submitted a detailed description of each station in order to facilitate its location in future years. 10% quinaldine solution spread throughout the study site to anesthertize fish.

Dataset methods
Continuous plankton recorder with a square aperture measuring 1.27 cm each side. The torpedo-shaped device is towed behind a ship at about 10 metres depth. Seawater and plankton enter the device through a small opening in the nose. This opening expands into a wider tunnel where the plantkon are trapped between two layers of silk and then preserved. In the laboratory, the silk layers are unrolled, cut into sections and plankton are then identified under the microscope. Formalin preserved samples identified in light microscopy.
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these would not be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab). The list of citations referenced in Table 1 will also give users information as to how this data has been previously used from the discrete projects.

In each area, square frames (five locations) are set up at two to three survey points, and a quantitative biosurvey (2mm sieve) is conducted to record the benthos that appear within the square frames (benthos: epifauna, infauna 2mm or larger). In addition, a qualitative biosurvey is conducted to record the benthos that appear around each survey point. 3. Annual Survey Overview: Since the 2008 fiscal year, surveys have been conducted once a year; The survey period is generally set between April and June; In the 2008 fiscal year, trials were conducted at the Akkeshi, Matsukawaura, Banzu tidal flat, Nanki Tanabe, Nakatsu tidal flat, Nagura tidal flat, and Ishigaki Kawahira Bay sites; The Shio River tidal flat survey began in the 2009 fiscal year; As of the 2021 fiscal year, there are 8 sites for the tidal flat survey; Both quantitative and qualitative surveys are conducted; Each site is divided into 1 to 3 areas (A, B, C), and within each area, 2 to 3 survey points are set (upper intertidal zone: U, middle intertidal zone: M, lower intertidal zone: L); At each site, a quantitative survey is conducted to observe changes in biomass, and a qualitative survey is conducted to assess the diversity of species within the site. 4. Number of Benthos Individuals Appearing within the Square Frame and Associated Data (Biological Quantitative Survey (2mm sieve)). At each survey point, five 50 cm square frames are randomly placed to record the epibenthic animals. Then, a 15 cm diameter core sampler (to a depth of 20 cm) is used to collect the organisms along with the sediment. The extracted organisms are then passed through a 2 mm sieve, and the infaunal species are recorded. Epibenthic animals are recorded as the number of individuals appearing within 0.25 m² (50 cm square frame), while infaunal animals are recorded as the number of individuals appearing within 0.0177 m² (15 cm diameter core). Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA. The data available here are: Number of benthic organisms that appeared within the square frame and associated data (quantitative biosurvey (2mm sieve)).","Epibenthic animals are recorded as the number of individuals appearing within 0.25 m² (50 cm square frame).",248,,"1.

In addition in areas where freshwater of shorebirds is to try to concentrate also performs monitoring of paddy fields and agricultural arable land.? (?) Survey number of times: Based on the record of 10 surveys of the past to the Ministry of the Environment shorebirds population fluctuation monitoring survey conducted in the (1999 to 2002) site type has been selected by the following criteria: In the core site species in order to grasp the maximum number of each time more accurately perform three or more times per survey period. In other general site but three or more of research is desirable if difficult it may be a one-time survey. Selection criteria of core site 1 - Ramsar wetlands in the registration or the East Asia and Australia that are participating in the regional shorebirds important habitat network. 2 - that you meet the Ramsar criteria (Appendix ?). 3 - East Asia and Australia that the entry criteria of local shorebirds important habitat network is more than more meets. 4 - countries designated wildlife sanctuary or that has been designated as an important wetland 500. 5- is that track record that provided the data to the investigation of the national level. Record: In each study site counting start time and end time of the survey in the paper ( fill in the time close to the investigation time band) low tide time and high tide time to record the number of individual species of interest in the investigation range . In addition survey sites name study area code study site location to fill the investigator name. Each investigator is most of the selected the time zone in which the number of individuals can be counted to conduct a survey. Therefore in an environment where a tide such as tidal flats estuaries band investigation time is not matter whether it is at the time or low tide is at high tide.Aggregation of simultaneous investigation: The survey was conducted before and after 1 week (15 days) of simultaneous survey date and simultaneous investigation. Simultaneous investigation other than the survey date set to the time a lot of number of individuals in the study period. Spring and fall and winter of each one but is set to be carried out an investigation on the same day across the country this is by carrying out the count in the period in which to concentrate as much as possible snipes plovers that are brought over to Japan as a whole at some point in time Ru Dare to understand the majority of the total number of individuals of the kind. If we study all at once survey date it prevents the result by counting duplicate the same herd in a different place leading to the understanding of a more exact number of individuals . In particular in close proximity to the region study the combined date and time is desirable.Than shorebirds of observation record in the maximum number of counting each study site the maximum number of the things that was extracted the largest number for each species. This the maximum number of the investigation period by the (spring autumn winter) aggregated to to understand the seasonal changes and the annual change of the tri- state in each study site.

Site selection and evaluation: We used a design that allowed for an equal distribution of sampling locations. Spatially-balanced sampling approaches have recently been developed (e.g. Stevens and Olsen 2004 Olsen et al. 2012) that incorporate similar characteristics as random or systematic ones but also guarantee that all samples are evenly distributed across the entire sampling frame (rather than clumping commonly associated with random sampling or distinct intervals associated with systematic sampling). Sites were chosen from Floridas Statewide Seagrass polygon Geographic Information System (GIS) data set compiled by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission-Fish and Wildlife Research Institute Center for Spatial Analysis (FWRI 2007).  We used an Albers Equal Area projection for the shapefile. The file which includes all seagrass coverage across the state of Florida was clipped to include only the Big Bend region from the St. Marks River in the north and the Anclote River in the south. From the clipped polygon we then chose sites using the spsurvey package (Kincaid et al. 2008) in the R software environment (R Development Core Team 2008). We choose a target of100 sites per sampling season (example R code for 2009 site selection provided in BBSG_2009-2010_site_selection_code_2009.txt; see Class V.C.). However because we anticipated that sampling could not be conducted at some sites (e.g. due to lack of target habitat logistical constraints) we also chose additional oversampling sites to replace target sites that had to be dropped from the initial sample. Based on pilot trials conducted in the northern region of our study area during the summer of 2008 we chose a 23% oversample for our 2009 season (100 target + 23 oversample). Based on the 2009 sampling season we chose a 27% oversample in 2010 (100 target + 27 oversample). Ideally sampling would proceed by first visiting all target sites then visiting the required number of oversampled sites to meet the target sample size. However this two-step approach was not possible in the current study given the large area over which sites were located. We therefore visited all oversampled sites as we visited target ones (i.e. we did not back track). Fourteen of the 123 sites that were drawn in 2009 and nine of the 127 sites from 2010 were dropped due to navigational hazards; typically this meant the site was located in a channel used by other boaters was located in extremely shallow water that we were unable to access or trawl or there was a physical barrier such as an oyster bar or shoal that precluded access. The remaining 109 sites from 2009 and 118 sites from 2010 were evaluated for suitable habitat to conduct sampling.Once we arrived at a site we determined whether it could be sampled based on two criteria: (1) it had to include ? 10% seagrass cover and (2) there were no hazards present to the trawl (e.g. due to presence of rocks or other hard substrate) the research vessel or researchers (e.g. due to navigational hazards such as extremely shallow water) or other boaters (e.g. due to presence of other boats anchored or heavy boat traffic). If the site did not meet both criteria we began piloting the research vessel in a spiraling manner around the site location to determine if there was suitable habitat nearby. We continued the spiraling until we had traveled 250 m from the original site (i.e. 500 m diameter circle 196350 m? area around site). If no suitable habitat was found we dropped the site and noted the reason. Among the sites evaluated 91 of the 109 in 2009 and 79 of the 118 in 2010 met the two criteria. The primary reason for a site not meeting both criteria was that it had less than 10% seagrass cover (usually with no seagrass) often with other floral (e.g. attached macroalgae) faunal (e.g. octocorals sponges) or geological characteristics (e.g. rocky reefs) that may have been incorrectly interpreted as seagrass from the aerial photos used to inform the GIS shapefile.B.2. Faunal data collection: If suitable habitat was found either at the site or from our spiraling search we sampled it using beam trawls (mouth opening: 1.87 meter (m) wide by 0.40 m tall; bag dimensions: 19 mm mesh with 3 mm mesh liner) towed on both sides of a 6.1 m research vessel (Fig. 2). Beam trawls were the most appropriate gear for our study for several reasons. First water depths in the region exceeded 5 m at some sites precluding the use of seine nets and drop traps that are commonly used in shallow seagrass beds (Edgar et al. 2001). Additionally we sought to sample across a large area within each site thus requiring a towed trawl gear. Beam trawls are advantageous over otter trawls (which is a commonly used towed gear in seagrass systems) because they retain a constant sampling volume during tows both across sites (otter trawl sampling volume can be affected by bottom substrate which varies across the study region) and within them (otter trawl sampling volume decreases as the net fills because the doors are pulled inward) (Rozas and Minello 1997 Stallings et al. 2014a). Higher and less variable capture efficiencies in beam trawls have also been attributed to the fixed mouth opening (Kuipers et al. 1992). Indeed Zimmerman et al. (1986) demonstrated that beam trawls had markedly higher capture efficiencies of penaeid shrimp (a common seagrass fauna) than seines and otter trawls. Additionally otter trawls tend to ride on top of submerged aquatic vegetation allowing animals to escape underneath the net resulting in low capture efficiency (Leber and Greening 1986 Stallings et al. 2014a). Conversely we demonstrated in pilot trials that the beam trawls remained in contact with the seafloor while being towed at varying depths on different substrates (e.g. soft sand compacted sand) and in different seagrass compositions and areal coverage. We towed the trawls from the sides of the boat (instead of astern) to eliminate problems with prop-wash on catch rates in shallow water. The trawls were towed for 2.5 minutes at a standard rate of 1.8?2.0 km/h (ca. 85 m). This tow speed (based on direct underwater observation) was determined to be the most efficient; faster tows caused the net to ride off the bottom and slower tows allowed animals to escape (personal observation during gear trials). The towing direction was determined a priori with a random number generator from 1-360 (i.e. the heading direction in degrees). However the trawl gears operate most efficiently and safely (i.e. avoiding contact with boat motor propeller) when towed downwind so we adjusted accordingly. The locations of the start and end of each tow were marked in decimal degrees using a Global Positioning System (GPS) which allowed us to measure tow distance and calculate the area sampled.All captured animals were identified to the lowest possible taxon and most were counted and measured in size classes. We did not count or measure the sizes of colonial fauna (e.g. ectoprocts ascidians) the tests of tube worms (e.g. sabellariids) or the shells of worm snails (e.g. vermetids) but we noted their presence. Among the major groups of fauna observed we were able to identify 93.4% of the taxa to species for actinopterygian fishes (92 taxa) 85.2% for bivalves (34 taxa) 85.0% for echinoderms (20 taxa) 76.8% for gastropods (95 taxa) and 70.1% for arthropods (87 taxa). Due to the large quantity of animals that had to be measured we used size classes to expedite the process. Based on previous research using trawl gears in seagrass beds (e.g. Stallings et al. 2010) we used six size classes for the current study: (1) 1-25 mm (2) 26-50 mm (3) 51-75 mm (4) 76-100 mm (5) 101-150 mm (6) ? 151 mm. We measured the total length for teleosts carapace width for crabs post-orbital head length for shrimp diameter for echinoderms and longest plane for molluscs. Once animals were identified counted and measured they were then released back into the water. Care was taken to minimize harm to the animals. Some animals were retained to allow for identification in the laboratory where microscopes and detailed taxonomic keys were present (keys used: Schultz 1969 Morris 1973 Hoese and Moore 1977 Lindner 1978 Abbott et al. 1985 Abele and Kim 1986 Robbins et al. 1986 Kaplan 1988 Littler 1989 Kensley and Schotte 1989 Humann and DeLoach 1992 Humann and DeLoach 1994 Abbott et al. 1995 Hendler 1995 Hoese and Moore 1998 McEachran and Fechhelm 1998 Voss 2002 Pomory 2007 Mikkelsen and Bieler 2008; supplemental online resources used: http://www.algaebase.org/ http://www.fishbase.org/ http://www.gastropods.com/ http://www.itis.gov/ http://www.jaxshells.org/ http://www.marinespecies.org/ http://www.sealifebase.org/ ).In addition to fauna the catch in trawl nets often included seagrass blades and drift algae. It was important to remove animals that were attached to the seagrass and entrained in the drift algae. During the 2009 field season we did this by vigorously rinsing all plant materials in 19 liter buckets filled with seawater. The seawater was then drained through a 0.5 mm wire sieve and remaining materials which were mostly fauna mixed with sediments and plant debris were placed in a plastic bag labeled with site location. The sample was frozen and animals were identified and measured in the laboratory.The seawater rinse did well to remove most animals attached to the plant materials. This was readily confirmed by visual inspection of seagrass blades where no animals remained attached after the rinse. However we were concerned at the end of the 2009 field season that a more careful approach was needed to accurately count the number of very small arthropods and molluscs commonly associated with the drift algae. We therefore slightly altered our protocols to separate fauna from drift algae for the 2010 field season. We continued to use a vigorous seawater rinse of seagrass blades in 2010. For the drift algae we would first separate all large fauna (e.g. most fishes large crabs) leaving only the smallest arthropods and molluscs. The total volume of the drift algae captured was then measured using a calibrated 19 liter bucket. In 2009 the median volume of drift algae per tow was 15142 mL. In 2010 we collected a 3785 mL subsample of drift algae which was approximately 25% of this median value. The 3785 mL subsample was taken by haphazardly grabbing small clumps from the algae collected in the trawl. We used this haphazard selection to avoid subsampling a single small section of the algae. The entire subsample was bagged labeled frozen and taken back to the laboratory. In the laboratory the algae was first vigorously rinsed in 19 liter buckets containing seawater and remaining sample sieved as was done during the 2009 field season. The rinsed algae was then carefully inspected for the presence of remaining fauna. As suspected small arthropods and molluscs remained entrained in the algae. These animals were meticulously removed by picking each individual with forceps. Animals were then identified counted and measured. Site abundances for these subsampled animals were calculated as the number of animals counted multiplied by the percent of subsampled algae (total volume of captured drift algae / volume of subsampled drift algae).

During this period of research 8 standard trawl surveys were carried out in the upper epipelagic layer (0?50 m) of this area. These surveys have continued a series of long-term field research of Pacific salmon and their environment nekton (fish squid) which was launched in the region in the 1980s. Averaging of the received information carried out by standard biostatistical areas (Shuntov 1986 1988;. Volvenko 1998 2003; Nekton ... 2005; Macrofauna ... 2012). Trawls were performed on the same type scientific research vessels TINRO and Professor Kaganovsky by midwater trawls 80/396 m  with fine-meshed insertion. Average trawling speed was 46 with an average area of the trawl fishing on 0417 km2 for 1 h. Removal and retention of flap on the surface are achieved when the length of the warp was 238-354 m on average 278.6 m. As a spacer device used pterygopalatine-tapered planks 6.0 m2 and weighing 1300 kg. trawl Disclosure determined by sensor of the apparatus SIMRAD FS 20/25. Vertical disclosure was on the average 33.1 m horizontal - 48.5 m. Abundance and biomass of each species or group of Nekton per unit area - square kilometer (ind. / km2 kg / km2.) calculated according to the formula for each trawl station below <...>. This method of calculation is different from the classic square (Aksyutina 1968) only by the introduction of two amendments p and the k compensating underestimation of aquatic organisms. In our case k - is ?ku? trawl catchability coefficient applied individually for each type of aquatic organisms according to the accepted practice in similar ecosystem surveys gradations (Volvenko 1998; Nekton ... 2005; Macrofauna ... 2012). All tables graphs and figures used in the work were built based on Nekton database TINRO center. The species names of fish were checked and corrected according to the classification adopted by Eshmayeru (http://research.calacademy.org/research/ichthyology/catalog/fishcatmain.asp) squid list was refined by KN Nesis (1982). Biomass of mesopelagic species committing vertical migrations at night (in particular all myctophids and some squid) have been translated only for a night trawling.

H. Karst). On January 16, 2007, an area of c. 1000 ha of mature Norway spruce forests was felled by the windstorm Kyrill. From those 1000 ha, four larger patches were selected totalling about 200 ha to remain unlogged; on the remaining 800 ha, storm-felled trees were removed by experimental post-disturbance logging up to August 2007. Afterwards, 44 plots, 22 in logged areas and 22 in unlogged areas. During logging operations, branches were cut off the trunk and left on the ground, and the main trunk was removed. Following this, dead wood resources were reduced from c. 300 m3/ha to c. 50 m3/ha in all 22 logged areas (details in Thorn et al. 2014, 2015). This dataset is part of a multi-taxon study, where 8 different taxonomic groups were monitored across plots that had the 2 different regimes (logged VS unlogged).
Bird censuses were performed five times per year from mid-March to mid-June in 2010, 2012 and 2014. This schedule ensures detection of early resident breeding birds as well as late-arriving long-distance migrants (Sudbeck et al., 2005). We used transect-based point-stop counts with a fixed radius of 50 m around the centroid of each plot, resulting in 900 (60 plots * five visits per year * three survey years) individual point-stop counts (Hutto et al., 1986, Moning and Muller, 2008). On each plot, all bird individuals seen and/or heard during a time period of 5 min were recorded. Surveys were only conducted on days without rain, with low wind speed, and clear or slightly overcast sky (Bibby et al., 2000).","Bird species were counted using a fixed radius point-stop-count method (50 m radius, 5 min interval)",819,," FM biomass and depth set to zeroes from NULLs, VB split the dataset according to management measure.",No,"Simon Thorn, VB",N,Mar-24,1,Count,1,,327,0,treatment_siteCode1_siteCode2_year,404,272,"@Article{BioTIME_cit272,

FM Kusaki is located at the upper Watarase river basin, in Midori City, Gunma Prefecture, central Japan (36°32?N, 139°25?E; 640?m to 1,140?m?a.s.l., Figure 1). This site belongs to a cool temperate region (warmth index, 69.6°C; coldness index 21.7°C). The mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation from 1997 to 2013 were 9.0°C and 1807?mm, respectively (Koyanagi et al., 2003; Urakawa et al., 2015). Precipitation increases in mid-summer and decreases in winter, and snow precipitation is at most approximately 300?mm (Urakawa et al., 2015). The bed rock in this area is mainly composed of sandstone and clayslate. Sika deer (Cervus nippon) population has been increasing since 2000 in Gunma Prefecture, and was estimated to be more than 1,500 in Midori City (ca. 208?km2) in 2012 (Gunma Prefecture, 2015). In FM Kusaki, herbivory by Sika deer is markedly increasing yearly. A 1-ha permanent plot (100?m?×?100?m) for elucidating long-term forest dynamics was established at a deciduous broad-leaved forest in a wide valley bottom of FM Kusaki in 2005 shown in Figure 1. This plot was subdivided into horizontal 10 m?×?10 m grid cells (Watanabe, Kuwabara, Hoshino, Kuwabara, & Kaneko, 2007), according to methods of the Monitoring Sites 1000 Project in Japan (Ministry of the Environment, 2011). To include vegetation from the valley bottom to the ridge condition, we expanded the plot by increasing the number of grid cells (10 m?×?10 m), resulting in a total of ca. 3-ha plot in the forest, although the dataset only currently includes data from the 1 ha plot. There are active channels (less than 1 m width) and microtopographies such as alluvial fans, talus slopes, foot slopes, head hollows and channel walls, leading to various ground disturbances in this plot. In addition, deer fences were built with 2-m wooden poles and iron wires or nylon nets at 6 grid cells in 2009 for elucidating effects of deer grazing on vegetation as shown in Figure 1.
The dominant tree species were F. platypoda on the valley bottom, and Quercus crispula and Castanea crenata on the side slope in the 1 ha permanent plot (Fukamachi, Hoshino, Yoshikawa, & Watanabe, 2011). On the western exterior of the plot, there was a conifer plantation. This oak and chestnut secondary forest may have been used for cutting fuelwood because there was a trace of charcoal grill kiln at the valley bottom. The forest stand including the plot, belonged to the national forest and the last record of forest operations was in 1893. Our dataset was based on the standardized methods of the Monitoring Sites 1000 Project in Japan (Ministry of the Environment, 2011). All living trees including lianas with girth at breast height (GBH)???15?cm in the 1-ha plot were attached with aluminum numbering tags (Racetrack Aluminum Tags, Forestry Supplies Inc.), and were identified at species level. The position of each tree base was measured from one corner of the grid cell as the X and Y coordinates in the grid cells. A tree census was conducted at this plot in August and September of each year since 2005. The census included GBH, tree height, death, tree vigor and recruitment (individuals growing GBH???15?cm in the survey year). About tree vigor,” we have checked visually and recorded in remarks in the table such as condition of tree tip, presence of rot and damages by nearby tree and deer.SUMMARY: Data collected in censuses of trees, litter fall and vegetation in a mountain riparian forest, upstream of the Watarase river, Gunma Prefecture in central Japan. A 1 - ha permanent plot (100m × 100m) subdivided into horizontal 10m × 10m grid cells was established in the forest in 2005. Tree census with woody species  larger or equal to 15 cm girth at breast height was conducted every year from 2005. Twenty - five litter traps were set in the permanent plot. The samples of litter fall were collected monthly, except in winter, between 2005 and 2008. And we sorted into leaves, branches, reproductive organs and other plant material, at species level as much as possible. The percentage cover of vascular plants was recorded at each vertical stratification (tree layer, subtree layer, shrub layer and herb layer) in 2008 and 2014 at the plot. These data are valuable for elucidating long - term forest dynamics at mountain upstream areas experiencing frequent ground disturbances.","Vegetation cover estimation in horizontal 10 m × 10 m grid cells within a 1-ha plot.",466,,"Fukamachi2020_VegetativeCoverJapan.JC.R.

Both sites were resampled in 2001 and 2007, and the exposed site was resampled in 2002 and 2003. In 2009, both sites were sampled again, and a Microsoft Access database was created with comparable data from previous years (1997-2007). Data is presented here for invertebrate density.
Wizard Islet (48°5129.5”N, 125°0931”W) is located within the Deer Group Islands in Barkley Sound and has an area of 1.73 hectares at low tide. The sheltered site (with less wave exposure) is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the northeast side and is characterized by Fucus and Phyllospadix (seagrass). The exposed site is located on a 50m stretch of fixed rocky shore on the southwest side and is characterized by Egregia (feather-boa kelp), goose-necked barnacles and Alaria (brown alga).
Fifteen transects were randomly selected at the sheltered site (tag numbers 7, 10, 11, 12, 15, 18, 21, 26, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 48) and the exposed site (tag numbers 1, 3, 5, 11, 15, 17, 20, 23, 25, 32, 37, 40, 44, 46, 48).
Sampling was done at tidal heights of 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 3.5m. In 2009 tidal height of 0.5m was not sampled due to time constraints and limited low tide series. Quadrats of 25x25cm were used for percent cover of bare rock, algae, colonial and encrusting species. Quadrats of 25x25cm were also used for counts of invertebrates with the exception of seastars which were counted in 50x50cm quadrats. To maintain consistency, all quadrats were positioned to the left and above each point on the transect (when facing away from the water).","Quadrats of 25x25cm were used for the counts of invertebrates with the exception of seastars, which were counted in 50x50cm quadrats.",469,,Anderson_2019_Algae+Inverts_JC,,"James Cant",,Mar-24,7,Density,1,,172,,lat_long_site_exposure_transect_tidalHeight_year_month_day,588,348,"@Dataset{BioTIME_cit348,

The time period of data collection varied among the 11 kelp forest sites. Sampling at Bulito, Carpinteria, and Naples began in summer 2000, sampling at the other six mainland sites (Arroyo Burro, Arroyo Hondo, Arroyo Quemado, Goleta Bay, Isla Vista, Mohawk) began in summer 2001 (transects 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 at Isla Vista were added in fall 2011). Data collection at the two Santa Cruz Island sites began in summer 2004. Annual measurements of the abundance of all understory macroalgae including small M. pyrifera (< 1 m in height) were converted to de-calcified dry mass using taxon-specific relationships with percent cover or size-specific density developed for 23 taxa that accounted for more than 95% of the standing biomass of understory macroalgae averaged across locations sampled seasonally from 2008 to 2018 (algae biomass relationship data table in
https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=127. The conversion of abundance to de-calcified dry mass for less common taxa was done by proxy using the relationship generated for a morphologically similar species. Biomass was converted from de-calcified dry mass to units of wet mass and ash free dry mass using ratios developed from tissue samples collected for common taxa. Wet mass and ash free dry mass of less common taxa were calculated using conversions for proxy taxa, when necessary.
Decalcified dry to wet mass, decalcified dry to ash free dry mass, decalcified dry to carbon mass, and decalcified dry to nitrogen mass conversions are provided in data package https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=127. Proxy species for these measures are presented in. Biomass for the seagrass, Zostera marina, was converted from de-calcified dry mass to wet mass using the relationship of Wickham et al. 2018 and was converted from de-calcified dry mass to carbon, nitrogen, and ash-free dry mass using the relationship of Van Lent et al. 1991. Size data for understory species whose abundance is measured as density (i.e., the kelps Pterygophora californica and Laminaria farlowii, and the fucoid, Stephanocystis osmundaceae) were not collected prior to 2008. To estimate the biomass of these species prior to 2008 we derived relationships between decalcified dry mass and density for adult and juveniles of each species using data from all sites and transects from 2008-2018. We applied the slope of these relationships to measured adult and juvenile densities to estimate the dry mass of these species
from 2000-2007. Divers also counted the density of M. pyrifera fronds > 1 m in height in the 40 m x 2 m transects. The density of M. pyrifera fronds > 1 m in height was converted to the biomass of giant kelp by applying the relationship between frond density (no. m-2) in August and dry mass density (dry kg
m-2) developed by Rassweiler et al. (2018). Annual measurements of the abundance of macroinvertebrate species were converted to shell free (i.e., decalcified) dry mass using taxon-specific relationships with size-specific density or percent cover developed for the 78 most common taxon (invertebrate biomass relationship data table in https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=127. Size data for invertebrates were not collected prior to 2008. Thus for 2000 to 2007 we estimated species-specific biomass of invertebrates for each transect using the long-term (2008 to present) mean size of juveniles and adults for that transect multiplied by their measured density. The conversion of abundance to mass for less common invertebrate taxa was done by proxy using the relationship generated for a morphologically similar species. Annual measurements of the abundance and size of reef fish (i.e., those observed within 2m of the
benthos) was converted to wet mass (g) using species-specific relationships obtained from the
literature (fish biomass relationship data table in https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=127. For somespecies, relationships were derived for standard length to mass. In these cases, we used information provided from the author to convert measurements of total length to standard length
prior to estimating wet mass. The wet mass of bony fishes was converted to de-boned dry mass (g) and ash free dry mass (g) using the average of conversion ratios for all reef fish provided in Taylor (1997). Wet mass of cartilaginous fishes was converted to dry biomass (g) using the conversion factor of Thorson 1976. No information was found to convert wet mass to ash free dry mass for cartilaginous fishes. Published relationships were not available for every fish species encountered on SBC LTER reefs. Therefore, we estimated the biomass of these species by proxy using the relationship published for a morphologically similar species (Table 3). Note, the accuracy of sampling fish may vary with water clarity and data collected during sampling events when horizontal visibility was < 2 m should be used with caution.  SUMMARY: These data are part of a collection of ongoing data sets that describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of kelp forest communities in the Santa Barbara Channel. Data on the abundance (density or percent cover) and size of ~250 species of reef associated macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes, substrate type and bottom topography are collected annually by divers in the summer within fixed plots (i.e. 40 m x 2 m transects) at 11 sites (n = 2 to 8 transects per site) that have historically supported giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Species-specific relationships between size (or percent cover) and mass developed for the region are used to covert abundance data to common metrics of mass (e.g., wet, dry, de-calcified dry) to facilitate analyses of community dynamics involving all species. Data collection began in 2000 and is ongoing.","Data collected within fixed plots (i.e. 40 m x 2 m transects) at 11 sites (n = 2 to 8 transects per site) that have historically supported giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera).",474,,"Dry weight selected as measure of biomass (Dry weight versus weight) as it better accounts for differences in water retention across taxa.

We use monthly pitfall trapping and annual Winkler sampling to assess the composition, phenology and abundance of arthropod communities within the experiment; each plot has four pitfall traps (5 cm diameter) that are located c. 1 m inside of the chamber walls or edges of the chamberless control plots. Each month, pitfall traps are filled with 6080 mL of 95% EtOH and left uncovered for 48 h during precipitation-free conditions.

Changes in canopy structure and ant assemblages affect soil ecosystem variables as a foundation species declines. Ecosphere, 6(5), pp.1-20.
HF-HeRE is sited in Petersham, Massachusetts, within the 121-ha Simes tract at the Harvard Forest (42.4742.48° N, 72.2272.21° W; 215300 m a.s.l). A full description of HF-HeRE is in Ellison et al. (2010); only pertinent details are mentioned here. The experiment, established in 2003, consists of eight ?90 × 90 m (0.81-ha) plots, divided into two blocks. The four plots in the valley” block are situated in the central valley of the tract, whereas those on the ridge” block are ?500 m northeast of the valley plots. The valley block is characterized by poorly drained, swampy soils. Besides T. canadensis, A. rubrum, P. strobus, and mixed hardwoods are common in the valley block. Soils in the ridge block are better drained, and this area is dominated by Q. rubra, Q. alba L., and P. strobus, in addition to T. canadensis.
Within each block, three hemlock-dominated (>65% of the canopy and basal area) plots and one hardwood plot were sited at the beginning of the experiment. Of the three hemlock-dominated plots, one was left untreated as a hemlock control” while the other two were manipulated. In the girdled” plots, the bark and cambium of every individual hemlock stem were cut through in May 2005 to simulate rapid decline and tree death associated with adelgid infestation (Yorks et al. 2003). In the logged” plots all hemlocks >20 cm DBH, 50% of merchantable oak and pine, and some poor-quality red maple and birch (for firewood) were felled and removed between February and April 2005 to mimic standard silvicultural practices used to salvage the value of the timber before the adelgid arrives (Foster and Orwig 2006). Because of the large size of the plots and the aspect of the blocks, plots were not randomly arrayed. Rather, to avoid shading manipulated plots in each block by the associated hemlock control plot, logged plots were always sited south of hemlock control plots, and girdled plots were in between the logged and hemlock control plots. Plots were separated from one another by 510 m. The fourth plot in each block was a hardwood control” plot dominated by young hardwoods, and which represented the expected near-term (2050 year) structure of forests from which hemlock has been lost (i.e., a space-for-time substitution) (Albani et al. 2010). In each block, the hardwood control was located >100 m from the three hemlock plots. Together, these four plot types are intended to serve as a short-term chronosequence of forests invaded by the adelgid; hemlock control plots represent hemlock stands pre-invasion, girdled and logged plots represent the immediate effects of infestation and salvage logging respectively, and hardwood control plots represent the eventual future of invaded stands.
Within each canopy treatment plot, six 3 × 3 m ant manipulation subplots were installed in April 2006. Three subplot types were installed: control,” disturbance control,” and ant exclosure.” Each subplot type was replicated twice within each canopy treatment plot and was randomly sited within the 7200 m2 area of the canopy manipulation plot outside of the central 30 × 30 m core” area (which is otherwise intensively sampled for many other variables: Ellison et al. 2010) and at least 15 m from the edge of the canopy manipulation plot. This split-plot design (small replicate ant manipulation subplots within each large canopy manipulation plot) was used to separate direct effects of changes in ant assemblage structure on soil ecosystem variables from those caused by canopy manipulations and adelgid infestation, which themselves may affect ant species composition (Ellison et al. 2005a, Sackett et al. 2011).
In each of the ant manipulation and associated control subplots, two 7-cm diameter × 10-cm deep, 230-ml plastic cups (pitfall traps”) were buried flush with the soil surface. From 2006 through 2014, three times each summer, traps were opened, partially filled (20 ml) with a mixture of water and a few drops of dishwashing detergent, and then left uncovered for 48 hours, after which time all ants in the pitfalls were removed, counted, and identified to species following Ellison et al. (2012). Voucher specimens are deposited in Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology. In addition to supplying necessary data on ant assemblages that could be associated with changes in soil ecosystem variables, data from the control pitfalls were used to test for differences in ant assemblage composition among the canopy treatment plots, and data from the exclosures were used to verify that the exclosures effectively reduced ant activity.","Monthly pitfall trap monitoring of ants in experimental plots",491,,"Curator transformed provided coordinates from NAD83 Massachusetts to WGS84 decimal degrees.

The traps had been set in the field for 11 or 14 days. The temperature for the sampling periods ranged from 13.4°C to 35.6°C with average of 23.8°C (24.1°C in 2003, 26.8°C in 2004, and 20.5°C in 2005) (Korea Meteorological Administration [2013]). Precipitation during the sampling period was 200 mm in 2003, 8 mm in 2004, and 32 mm in 2005. The LTER site (1 ha) was divided into 100 plots (10 m?×?10 m), using plastic pipes. Three pitfall traps were set along a transect of 2-m intervals, in the center of each plot. A total of 300 traps were set up each year, but 300, 267, and 283 traps were returned for analysis in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. The unreturned traps were usually disturbed by boars.

The first transect route was surveyed between 2016 and 2017, whereas in 2018 the transect was slightly amended to avoid regions with few observations (i.e. a single batoid observation across all 20162017 surveys in the southern part of the transect).
Transect locations were chosen in order to survey varied habitats, as stingrays and guitarfish are seen in both sand and reef habitats, and in habitats with varying levels of complexity. The first transect was 1180 m in length and approximately 30 m in width, whereas the second transect was 800~ m in length but with the same width. The first transect consisted of 51% rocky reef and 49% sand cover, whereas the second transect consisted of 45% reef and 55% sand cover. The maximum depth of both transects was 7.5 m. The global positioning system (GPS) was used to map the survey route and navigation checkpoints. The site substrate (reef and sand cover percentages) was digitized using Google Earth satellite imagery. The survey was conducted using breath-hold diving along fixed transects, with beginning and end points alternated between weeks. Although 2016-2017 surveys slightly differ from the transects of 2018-2022, the two highly overlapp and are suggested as valid for continuous time series (2016-2022) by the authors (see section 2.1 in Chaikin, S., Belmaker, J., & Barash, A.

When a batoid was observed it was photographed and identified.Special body marks (e.g. scars, cut tail, stripes) were also documented and further used to avoid duplicate observations within the same survey. Between late April 2016 and late June 2017, the transect was repeated 55 times. In 2018 and 2022, the shorter transect was repeated 31 times over a period of 4 months starting from early March until early July (with 86 transects altogether).Surveys were conducted at different times of day (06:0018:00 h), but no relationship between the number of batoid observation per transect and time of day was found.for more information please see Chaikin, S., Belmaker, J., & Barash, A.

During each month, all shorebirds, gulls and other birds, including seabirds and terrestrial birds, are identified and counted on the selected 1 km segments at each study beach. Counts are conducted by a single observer who walks the 1 km transect, recording all birds on a standard data sheet. Birds are identified and counted using binoculars. Care is taken to avoid disturbing or double counting birds. As they are counted, all birds are assigned to intertidal zones (upper intertidal, mid-intertidal, below WTO, swash zone) and their behavior (feeding mode, roosting) is noted on a standard data form.

The biomass was determined based on the diameter at breast height/base diameter data collected during individual tree surveys. The individual biomass was summed within each plot, and the biomass per unit area (hectare) was calculated, expressed in kilograms per hectare (kg/ha). Abundance was reported as individuals per hectare (individuals/ha).","Three community surveys were conducted from 2008 to 2017 on three fixed plots representing different successional stages in a typical evergreen broadleaf forest in Tiantong, the subtropical area of east China.",627,,"Script: Tiantong_Forest_XK.R",N,"Xuejia Ke",N,Mar-24,7,Density,3,Weight,299,0,year_elevation,855,550,"@Dataset{BioTIME_cit550,

Sampling: Surface (5 m) water samples were taken with Niskin bottles attached to a CTD-rosette from oceanographic research vessels. Water samples were fixed with Lugol (final concentration 1%) and used for protistan plankton abundance estimations.
Water sample analysis: For abundance estimations, subsamples of seawater from the Niskin bottles were settled in 50-mL sedimentation chambers during 48 h. Then, single cells were counted in the chamber using a magnification of 400 in two inverted microscopes: a Wild M20 and a Zeiss axio vert A1, following techniques of Utermöhl (1958) and Hasle (1978). Organisms not identified at species or genus level were assigned to a higher taxonomic group such as Cryptophyta (phylum) or Amphidomataceae (family), or were grouped into size categories such as nanoflagellates between 10 and 20 ?m, ciliates between 2040 and 4060 ?m, and so on. 
Species identification was performed on net haul samples under a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, using phase contrast, differential interference contrast (DIC) and magnification of 1000 x. 
All protists were counted irrespective of trophic modes, because although phytoplankton are traditionally regarded to derive nutrition through photoautotrophy (e.g., diatoms), some dinoflagellates and ciliates (e.g., Dinophysis and Mesodinium, respectively) and most nanoflagellates (including the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi) are known to be mixotrophic (Glibert and Mitra 2022). Moreover, some dinoflagellates and ciliates are strict heterotrophs (e.g., Protoperidinium and Tintinnida, respectively) and are routinely included in phytoplankton counts. 
For biomass estimation (in ?C L-1), cell dimensions were measured throughout the counting procedure using an ocular micrometer. Thereafter, plankton cell volumes (in ?m3) were calculated assigning simple geometric shapes to species according to Hillebrand et al. 1999, and transformed into carbon content (pg C cell-1) using two different carbon-to-volume ratios, one for diatoms and one for all the other planktonic groups Menden-Deuer and Lessard, 2000.

Sampling: Surface (5 m) water samples were taken with Niskin bottles attached to a CTD-rosette from oceanographic research vessels. Water samples were fixed with Lugol (final concentration 1%) and used for protistan plankton abundance estimations.
Water sample analysis: For abundance estimations, subsamples of seawater from the Niskin bottles were settled in 50-mL sedimentation chambers during 48 h.

The undisturbed forest was used as a baseline, whereas primary forest corridors (100300?m wide) were considered a low-intensity modification, with strong edge and isolation effects. Eucalyptus plantations represent a highly disturbed site, as the native forest has been completely replaced by exotic trees. Both modified habitat types have a distinct dung beetle species composition and community structure, mainly by species replacement (turnover component of ?-diversity in Fig. S1). However, communities in Eucalyptus plantations are the most dissimilar to those in undisturbed forest (Fig. S1; Barlow et al., 2010). It is also important to highlight that the Eucalyptus trees are harvested each 45?years. Thus, most of our plantations sites were harvested during the study, we are aware that this activity can strongly affect the dung beetles community but this is one of the main disturbance in fast-growing crops and was represented in this study.”
We followed the protocol for dung beetle sampling in previous studies at same site (Barlow et al., 2007, Gardner et al., 2008, Barlow et al., 2010). Thus, we sampled dung beetles using pitfall traps baited with 30?g of human dung. The traps consisted of plastic containers (19?cm diameter and 11?cm deep), protected from rain with a plastic lid suspended 20?cm above the surface. Each trap was part-filled with water, salt, and detergent. Five pitfall traps were placed 150?m apart along a transect, with at least 500?m distance to the nearest edge in undisturbed forests. Collections took place once a year over a five-year period (20092013) during the wet season in each year. Beetles were sampled in exactly the same locations for 48?h per site in each year. Due to the large number of sites and the extensive area covered by our study, sampling took place over a 23?month period each year between late January and early June. However, to ensure comparable data among years, sampling was concentrated in March and April each year except 2013, when most sites were sampled one month earlier (see Table S2). In addition, sites within each habitat type were visited on each sampling date.
Dung beetle specimens were transported from the field to the laboratory in 90% ethanol, then sorted, dried and stored in paper envelopes. Beetles were identified using a key to the New Worlds Scarabaeinae genera and subgenera (Vaz-de-Mello et al., 2011), a field guide for dung beetles of the Jari River basin (Louzada, unpublished data), and a reference collection held at the Universidade Federal de Lavras (CREN  UFLA; Coleção de Referência de Escarabeíneos Neotropicais), Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Identifications were made to species level and, where there was uncertainty, a morphospecies number was given. Voucher specimens were deposited at CREN  UFLA.” [Extracted from Beiroz et al 2018]","In each site, five baited pitfall traps were placed 150m apart along a transect.

MPAs differed in their level of protection, also across the years, as enforcement measures changed throughout the surveys. We classified the protection level according to the regulation-based classification system for MPAs by Costa et al. (2016). Rosh Hanikra  Achziv was classified as level 4 protection  highly regulated ex-traction”. Shikmona as was classified as level 8  unregulated extraction” in 2015 and since 2016 the entire MPA was classified as level 4  highly regulated extraction”. Dor-Habonim was classified until 2016 as level 8  Unregulated extraction” and since 2016 as level 5  Moderately regulated extraction”.Gdor was classifies until 2017 as level 5  Moderately regulated” and since 2018 as level 4  highly regulated extraction”. In the data provided, there is no seperation among the MPAs. Within each sampling campaign we sampled in 24 (±3 SD) sites within and 19 (± 3 SD) sites outside the MPAs. In each site, between 2-8 belt transects were performed. In each transect, fish were recorded along 25X6m belt transects, up to a height of approx. 5m above the substrate. For each transect we used the following protocol: After descending along a rope tied to a pre-deployed buoy,the divers attached a measuring tape to the rope and started swimming. The documentation of the fish started only after 5m of swimming to reduce the interruption caused by the diver descent and preparations for sampling. The two divers documented fish identity and abundance, and estimated fish total length. Fish were identified to species level (excluding Mugilidae, Clupidae and Atherinidae, which are difficult to identify to species level underwater). Although species from the families Gobiidae, Blenniidae and Tripterygiidae are common on rocky substrate they are underestimated in visual surveys and thus omitted from the data.Biomass was calculated using the parameters of the length-weight relationship (W=aLb), where a and b were extracted from studies in Fishbase website (Froese & Pauly, 2000), using studies conducted as close as possible to the study area, with a preference for Eastern Mediterranean values.

Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier.

For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h. The entire chamber was analysed under a Wild M20 inverted microscope (Hasle, 1978).

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978.

Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.

The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h.

The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b). It is worth noting that collection and processing of samples have been consistent throughout the study period, including the identification and quantification of species under light microscopy. This high resolution plankton survey has been performed by the same group of specialists, ensuring that changes in the community structure and/or composition are due to environmental dynamics and not attributable to analytical processes. 
Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier. For phytoplankton and microzooplankon cells enumeration, surface water samples were taken using a Van Dorn bottle (2.5 l) and preserved in acidified Lugols solution. For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h. The entire chamber was analysed under a Wild M20 inverted microscope (Hasle, 1978).

Phytoplankton identification and counts were made by Manuel Varela (until 2010) and Jorge Lorenzo (2011-2016). These series are part of the long-term observational project RADIALES (Instituto Español de Oceanografía, IEO, Spain).[Extracted from Bode et al., 2023] The abundance unit is counts/litre.","Quantitative phytoplankton method (Utermöhl, 1958)",685,,"The data were downloaded from the original source repository and formatted to the BioTIME template. Information on day, month and year was extracted from “Date”. The central geographical coordinates indicated in the source were assigned to all records. Information on the depth of each sample was included in the column “DepthElevation”. The units of sampling were removed from the taxa names. NAs and 0s in “Abundance” were removed. Abundances were aggregated by sample. SampleDescription (i.e. sampling event) was Depth_Day_Month_Year. The data were split into two series (one until 2008, the other from 2008 to 2016) because the taxonomic resolution up until 2008 might have been coarser in the first years of the series.

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b).

Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier.

Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h.

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b). It is worth noting that collection and processing of samples have been consistent throughout the study period, including the identification and quantification of species under light microscopy. This high resolution plankton survey has been performed by the same group of specialists, ensuring that changes in the community structure and/or composition are due to environmental dynamics and not attributable to analytical processes. 
Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier. For phytoplankton and microzooplankon cells enumeration, surface water samples were taken using a Van Dorn bottle (2.5 l) and preserved in acidified Lugols solution. For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h. The entire chamber was analysed under a Wild M20 inverted microscope (Hasle, 1978).

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b).

Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier.

For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h.

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b). It is worth noting that collection and processing of samples have been consistent throughout the study period, including the identification and quantification of species under light microscopy. This high resolution plankton survey has been performed by the same group of specialists, ensuring that changes in the community structure and/or composition are due to environmental dynamics and not attributable to analytical processes. 
Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier. For phytoplankton and microzooplankon cells enumeration, surface water samples were taken using a Van Dorn bottle (2.5 l) and preserved in acidified Lugols solution. For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h. The entire chamber was analysed under a Wild M20 inverted microscope (Hasle, 1978).

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b).

Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier. For phytoplankton and microzooplankon cells enumeration, surface water samples were taken using a Van Dorn bottle (2.5 l) and preserved in acidified Lugols solution. For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h.

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b). It is worth noting that collection and processing of samples have been consistent throughout the study period, including the identification and quantification of species under light microscopy. This high resolution plankton survey has been performed by the same group of specialists, ensuring that changes in the community structure and/or composition are due to environmental dynamics and not attributable to analytical processes. 
Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier. For phytoplankton and microzooplankon cells enumeration, surface water samples were taken using a Van Dorn bottle (2.5 l) and preserved in acidified Lugols solution. For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h. The entire chamber was analysed under a Wild M20 inverted microscope (Hasle, 1978).

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b).

Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier.

For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h. The entire chamber was analysed under a Wild M20 inverted microscope (Hasle, 1978).

For phytoplankton and microzooplankon cells enumeration, surface water samples were taken using a Van Dorn bottle (2.5 l) and preserved in acidified Lugols solution. For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h. The entire chamber was analysed under a Wild M20 inverted microscope (Hasle, 1978). The units of Abundance are cells L-1, the units of Biomass are µgC l-1.","Samples taken with VanDorn bottles at 0.5 m depth during high tide and daytime",687,,"Rawdata files were sligthly reformatted in Excel for an easier load and processing in R.

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b). It is worth noting that collection and processing of samples have been consistent throughout the study period, including the identification and quantification of species under light microscopy. This high resolution plankton survey has been performed by the same group of specialists, ensuring that changes in the community structure and/or composition are due to environmental dynamics and not attributable to analytical processes. 
Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier. For phytoplankton and microzooplankon cells enumeration, surface water samples were taken using a Van Dorn bottle (2.5 l) and preserved in acidified Lugols solution. For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h. The entire chamber was analysed under a Wild M20 inverted microscope (Hasle, 1978). The units of Abundance are cells L-1, the units of Biomass are µgC l-1.","Samples taken with VanDorn bottles at 0.5 m depth during high tide and daytime",687,,"Rawdata files were sligthly reformatted in Excel for an easier load and processing in R.

Together with the sustained observations of protistan plankton, in situ sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (silicates, DIN and phosphate) have been continuously measured on a biweekly basis since 1978. The high frequency monitoring allowed the characterization of the phenology and biodiversity of the phytoplankton blooms in relation with changing environmental conditions (Gayoso 1981; 1989; 1998; Popovich and Gayoso 1999, Popovich et al. 2008; Guinder et al. 2010; 2012; 2013; 2015; 2016; 2017; López Abbate et al., 2017; Berasategui et al., 2021); and similarly with the microzooplankton (Pettigrosso 2003; Pettigrosso and Popovich 2009; Barría de Cao 2005; 2011; López Abbate et al. 2016; 2019a; 2019b).

Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.

The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h. The entire chamber was analysed under a Wild M20 inverted microscope (Hasle, 1978).

This high resolution plankton survey has been performed by the same group of specialists, ensuring that changes in the community structure and/or composition are due to environmental dynamics and not attributable to analytical processes. 
Samples were collected at a fixed station (Puerto Cuatreros, 38.50S; 62.20W), a shallow harbor (mean depth of 6 m) at the head of the Bahía Blanca Estuary.  Samples were collected at high tide and around noon time from a pier. For phytoplankton and microzooplankon cells enumeration, surface water samples were taken using a Van Dorn bottle (2.5 l) and preserved in acidified Lugols solution. For qualitative analysis, samples were collected using a Nansen 30 µm net and preserved with formaldehyde (final concentration 0.4%).
The phytoplankton abundance (in cells L-1) was determined using a Sedgwick-Rafter chamber (1 mL) under light microscopy from 1978-2008 (400x), and Utermöhl chambers under light inverted micrsocopy. The entire chamber was examined at 400x magnification, and each cell was counted as a unit (McAlice, 1971). Phytoplankton was identified at species level using a Zeiss Standard R microscope and a Nikon Eclipse microscope, with magnification of 1000x and phase contrast. In some cases, scanning electron microscopy was performed to identify diatom species. The quantification of microzooplankton (e.g. ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, as well as phytoplankton to contrast methodologies) was done by settling a variable volume (1050 ml, depending on sediment and plankton concentration) of preserved seawater sample in Utermöhl chambers during 24 h. The entire chamber was analysed under a Wild M20 inverted microscope (Hasle, 1978). The units of Abundance are cells L-1, the units of Biomass are µgC l-1.","Samples taken with VanDorn bottles at 0.5 m depth during high tide and daytime",687,,"Rawdata files were sligthly reformatted in Excel for an easier load and processing in R.

Tow duration was 90 min, measured from the point of optimal net opening to the moment when speed was reduced prior to raising the net. The average trawl speed was 2.8 knots and each haul covered an estimated area of 90,000 m2. The seabed at all trawled sites consisted of sand with a silt/clay fraction.
A total of 15 cruises (120 trawl tows) on typical inshore trawling grounds were carried out between April 2008 and January 2012 (Table 1). Each cruise consisted of eight tows, which were performed at 20 m and 40 m, an important depth range for Israeli fishing (including trawling).

Using a stereo microscope, all the animals were picked out of the residue, stored in vials containing 70% IMS, and identified to the lowest possible taxon with abundance and biomass per taxon noted. Biomass was obtained using blotted wet weight (± 0.0001g). The individual numbers of each taxa were counted to give abundance data. This was determined by the presence of a head in cases where specimens had been damaged. Any badly damaged specimens or parts of specimens where no head was present were separated into major group debris (annelid, mollusc and crustacea) pots and their presence noted as YES/NO for abundance). All molluscs were weighed inclusive of shells, tube dwelling polychaetes were weighed without tubes, and sediment was removed from the body cavity of specimens of Ctenodiscus crispatus prior to weighing.

Dataset methods
Sample collection via 1L bottle preserved with Lugols and identified with light microscopy
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these would not be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab). The list of citations referenced in Table 1 will also give users information as to how this data has been previously used from the discrete projects.

This recuration is from scratch with the latest version downloaded from AODN on January 2024. Because each project in the database used its own methods, I split projects into their own BioTIME datasets and preserved the sampleID provided. Projects were eliminated if metadata suggested datasets did not sample assemblages (single or targeted species), insufficient year duration, or recorded only presence absence data. Taxonomic cleaning was largely focused on uncertain species above family level. I removed any size or life stage information from these working taxa names but kept morphological terms that may be taxonomically relevant to distinguish between uncertain species (e.g. centric vs pennate diatoms).

The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value.

Dataset methods
Sample collection via methanol extraction preserved with Lugols and identified with light microscopy
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken.

If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these would not be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab).

Dataset methods
Methanol extraction of samples preserved in Lugol's solution. (BioTIME curator found a similar paper with possible matching methods from the data custodian, but this is not confirmed. The following methods may provide more details from Leterme et al. 2014 in Oceanologia) At each site and depth, 1 L samples of seawater were taken and preserved with Lugols iodine added to each bottle (0.5%) final concentration, Hajdu et al. 2007) for identification and enumeration of phytoplankton species (>5 ?m). Identification and enumeration of phytoplankton was carried out every two weeks by Microalgal Supply Service (Ormond, Victoria, Australia). The cells were identified up to the genus or species level based on their key taxonomic features (Tomas 1997, Hallegraef et al. 2010) and grouped according to their size and shape.
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN.

Dataset methods
Sample collection via 2L or 5L Niskin preserved with Lugols and identified with light microscopy. 
More detailed methods located by BioTIME curator that may apply to this dataset from the author's other published works. (The B line referred here is likely to refer to the data)The sampling design for this phytoplankton survey built on the established IMOS infrastructure at Coffs Harbour and stations were chosen to include the moorings CH070 and CH100 (Figs. 1, 2; section 1.5). Sampling was undertaken along a Northern and a Southern transect (hereafter B-line and CH-Line, respectively) about 30 km apart. An intermediate coastal station (SS) was included to create an alongshore-transect (Figs. 1, 2). The terminology used here is consistent with previous oceanographic work that has been conducted in the Coffs Harbour region within the IMOS context. The CH-Line and the B-Line extended 26 and 28 km off the coast, respectively. Phytoplankton sampling stations, numbered in ascending order (B2 and CH1, B4 and CH2, B6 and CH3, B8 and CH5) were located at the 25, 50, 70 and 100 m isobaths across the continental shelf (Figs. 1, 2). Both the CH and the B-line extend from the coastal SIMP into the adjacent Solitary Islands Marine Reserve (east of the 50 m isobath). Sampling was done monthly. The 2 L samples collected on board RV Bombora and RV Circe were transported to the laboratories of the Sydney Institute of Marine Sciences (SIMS, Chowder Bay, NSW) and concentrated by sedimentation. During the sedimentation procedure, the 2 L samples were settled for 48 hrs and siphoned twice, to achieve a final concentrated sample volume of 100 mL. Depending on the cell density, a 3 mL subsample of the 100 mL sample was counted, or the 100 mL sample was further concentrated within an Utermöhl sediment cylinder mounted onto a 3 mL counting chamber (HydroBios, Germany). Identification and enumeration under an inverted microscope (Leica DMI 3000B) followed the protocols of Utermöhl (1958). At least 400 cells per sample were counted at 200x.

Dataset methods
Sample collection via Van Dorn sampler, identified with light microscopy.
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13.

Dataset methods
BioTIME curator: No methods accompany this dataset from the database, but here are detailed methods from a potential related paper by Eriksen et al. 2018 in MEPS doi.org/10.3354/meps12420 
The SOTS Pulse mooring lies to the south of the Subtropical Front (STF), approximately 530 km southwest of Tasmania at 46° 56 S, 142° 15' E. A Remote Access Sampler (RAS-500 McLane Labs) filled forty-eight 500 ml Tedlar bags in pairs (collected 1 h apart at 02:00 and 03:00 UTC) at pre-programmed 9-d intervals, between 12 September 2010 and 7 April 2011. The RAS uses a common inlet and distributes samples to the bags via a multi-port valve without passing through a pump, thus avoiding mechanical damage of cells and potential contamination from pump components. The smallest cross-sectional area of the sampling flow path is 1.51 mm2 (diameter 1.39 mm) and thus should effectively sample all phytoplankton species, including colonial and chain-forming morphologies. Prior to deployment, the RAS was primed with approximately 5 ml of distilled, deionized water, filling all spaces to prevent air-locks. One bag in each pair was pre-loaded with saturated aqueous mercuric chloride (Alfa Aesar Puratronic, 99.999%, to achieve a final concentration of 80 ?M in the collected sample) for measurement of dissolved constituents (without filtration), including inorganic carbon, alkalinity and nutrients. The other bag in each pair was pre-loaded with microscopy-grade, low-acidity glutaraldehyde (Merck, final concentration 1%). Upon retrieval, samples were refrigerated at 4°C in the dark until analysis. Due to the biomass, samples were pre-concentrated by sedimentation. Sample bags were gently mixed, and the entire sample volume was decanted into 500 ml tall-form measuring cylinders, and Lugols iodine was added to aid sedimentation (Sournia 1978). The settled samples were drawn down to 100 ml after 1 wk, decanted into tall form 100 ml cylinders and concentrated to a final volume of 15 ml after a further 1 wk of settling. Pre-concentrated samples were stored in amber glass vials at 4°C until examination. Counts were performed on a 6 ml aliquot transferred to a Utermöhl chamber, using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope (differential interference contrast or phase contrast) at 320×. The highest magnification for identification was 630×.
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN.

If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/).

Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass; full methods are readily found in the literature24-26. Table 2 gives details conversions of phytoplankton size data to carbon biomass. Some of the data records are missing dates or coordinates. It was considered useful to keep these records as the presence of a taxa in a location may still be of value. The user may estimate coordinates from the location given and would then also be aware that these would not be the exact coordinates of the sample. Data can be analysed in many different ways and in many software applications (e.g. R Matlab). The list of citations referenced in Table 1 will also give users information as to how this data has been previously used from the discrete projects.

This dataset is a subset from the The Australian Zooplankton Database collated by Claire Davies under Project ID 22.
Dataset Methods:
This dataset contains records for Project ID 22: Zooplankton sampling from Maria Island.	All copepods identified to species; other taxa identified to family or functional group. The methods used to collect the data are: double/rectangular nets of mesh size = 300microns &amp; samples are from vertical depths ranging between 0 &amp; 1 m.
General BioTIME curators note for The Australian Zooplankton Database: please be aware that spatial sampling effort might not be consistent throughout sampling events in some projects/time-series. This can be resolved with gridding and rarefaction, however we strongly recommend against using data for study-level analyses whenever spatial effort varies largely across samples.
The Australian Zooplankton Database Metadata:
[extracted from https://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/278/metadata.php]
-Experimental or sampling design: Data have been collected using different equipment and sampling designs. Zooplankton have been generally collected by net, although Project 597 has used a Continuous Plankton Recorder. Nets used have varying mesh sizes and we have included these where available. Data have been sourced from research cruises, student projects, published literature and time series surveys. Details of each project are described in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. These metadata should allow users to understand how the data compare with those from other projects when analyzing across data sets.
The taxonomic resolution for each project varies according to the aims of each specific survey. This can be especially important when using the data to interpret absences. Absences can be (a) true where the analyst did not find the target taxa, or (b) not truly representative; when the taxa were not sampled for or identified at low resolution (e.g., copepod naupliar lifestages), or the analyst did not look for the particular taxa and presence or absence was not determined. The resolution to which each data set was counted is detailed in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. We recommend that if a taxon is not mentioned within a project then a real absence should not be interpreted. If a taxon is mentioned in some samples and not others, from within the same data set, a real absence can be inferred.
-Taxonomy and systematics: All species names have been verified in the process of uploading the data. Each species name has been updated to the current accepted scientific name according to WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species). For taxa where species identifications cannot be confirmed, a higher taxonomic level has been applied. Much of the data set also includes information on gender for copepods because species identification usually necessitates determination of gender. Taxonomic sheets, which provide species identifications and distribution maps, have been published for many of the common species (mainly copepods) included here and can be found at the Australian Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas website (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013).
All data have been standardised to abundance (number per m3 of water filtered) and are therefore comparable across data sets (within the constraints of mesh size and sampling procedures). The sample depth and the water depth at the sample location have been included as fields in the data file so the user can to convert to abundance per m² using whichever depth is relevant to their requirements. This will increase the usability of the data set and improve comparability between shallow and deep tows and locations. The Australian Bathymetry and Topography, June 2009 (http://www.ga.gov.au/corporate_data/67703/Rec2009_021.pdf) and ETOPO2v2 2006 (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO2/ETOPO2v2-2006/) were used to estimate the water depth for each sample location.
We have given the average total length of adult copepods, since copepods have determinate growth, and the body size data is easily available and accepted. The juvenile size is assumed as the smallest adult size in the range given for the adult of that species. The majority of the copepod length data has been compiled from Bradford-Grieve et al. (1999) and the marine planktonic copepod website (Razouls et al. 2005-2014). Other sources were Ruth Böttger-Schnack via personal communications for Oncaeaidae and Frost and Fleminger (1968) for Clausocalanus. Size coefficients are not given for other taxa, for which the sizes are not well known and can vary greatly depending on age (not recorded in the datasets) or environmental conditions.
Surveys pertaining only to ichthyoplankton have not been included in this data set. They potentially warrant a separate database due to the volume of data available and there is already a considerable amount of data synthesis in this field.
-Data verification: Anomalous data, with uncertain species identifications, locations on land, or data with missing values have been excluded from the data set.
Exact sampling dates were not known for some projects and had to be estimated for Projects 18, 24, 29, and 615 from information given in the associated literature. The sampling date range is given in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. The temporal resolution of the sampling is detailed in the sample_year, sample_month, sample_day and sample_time_UTC fields of the file zooplankton_metadata.csv. Exact sampling locations were not known for some of the sampling sites in Project 615. These have been inferred from figures showing the ships track and sampling locations. These data will be adequate for use in long-term time series or mapping distribution, but care will be needed if associating these values with contemporaneous environmental variables.
-Data set usage history: Some of the included data have been used in the Australian Marine Zooplankton Taxonomic Guide and Atlas to map species distributions (Richardson et al. 2013, Swadling et al. 2013) and to provide initial comparisons of tropical copepod communities (McKinnon and Duggan 2014). Large-scale analysis of these data has not yet been undertaken, but it is hoped that the publication of this data set will facilitate further analysis. Most of the projects have been analysed for the purpose for which they were collected and published. Details of these publications and the projects can be found in the file zooplankton_metadata.csv.","Double/rectangular nets of mesh size = 300microns",779,330,"Formerly study ID 330 (see curation notes 8 & 9).

Dataset methods
BioTIME curator: No methods accompany this dataset from the database, but here are detailed methods from a potential related paper by Eriksen et al. 2018 in MEPS doi.org/10.3354/meps12420 
The SOTS Pulse mooring lies to the south of the Subtropical Front (STF), approximately 530 km southwest of Tasmania at 46° 56 S, 142° 15' E. A Remote Access Sampler (RAS-500 McLane Labs) filled forty-eight 500 ml Tedlar bags in pairs (collected 1 h apart at 02:00 and 03:00 UTC) at pre-programmed 9-d intervals, between 12 September 2010 and 7 April 2011. The RAS uses a common inlet and distributes samples to the bags via a multi-port valve without passing through a pump, thus avoiding mechanical damage of cells and potential contamination from pump components. The smallest cross-sectional area of the sampling flow path is 1.51 mm2 (diameter 1.39 mm) and thus should effectively sample all phytoplankton species, including colonial and chain-forming morphologies. Prior to deployment, the RAS was primed with approximately 5 ml of distilled, deionized water, filling all spaces to prevent air-locks. One bag in each pair was pre-loaded with saturated aqueous mercuric chloride (Alfa Aesar Puratronic, 99.999%, to achieve a final concentration of 80 ?M in the collected sample) for measurement of dissolved constituents (without filtration), including inorganic carbon, alkalinity and nutrients. The other bag in each pair was pre-loaded with microscopy-grade, low-acidity glutaraldehyde (Merck, final concentration 1%). Upon retrieval, samples were refrigerated at 4°C in the dark until analysis. Due to the biomass, samples were pre-concentrated by sedimentation. Sample bags were gently mixed, and the entire sample volume was decanted into 500 ml tall-form measuring cylinders, and Lugols iodine was added to aid sedimentation (Sournia 1978). The settled samples were drawn down to 100 ml after 1 wk, decanted into tall form 100 ml cylinders and concentrated to a final volume of 15 ml after a further 1 wk of settling. Pre-concentrated samples were stored in amber glass vials at 4°C until examination. Counts were performed on a 6 ml aliquot transferred to a Utermöhl chamber, using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope (differential interference contrast or phase contrast) at 320×. The highest magnification for identification was 630×.
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone.

This can be resolved with gridding and rarefaction, however we strongly recommend against using this dataset for study-level analyses.
Dataset methods
Plankton were sampled by water sample collections in 5 L Niskin bottles and preserved in Lugol's solution. Identified with light microscopy.
Database methods
Sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. 
Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. 
Taxa methods
All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. 
Data Records
Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id.
Technical Validation
The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records.
Usage Notes
The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13.

This study was formerly part of study 367, which was split as part of the database v2 revision. Dataset description: This is a survey conducted on tidal flats as part of the 1000 Monitoring Sites Coastal Zone Survey. A total of eight survey sites have been set up across the country, with annual surveys conducted continuously every fiscal year and five-yearly surveys conducted once every five years. 2. Annual survey description: Two to three survey areas are set up at eight survey sites across the country. In each area, square frames (five locations) are set up at two to three survey points, and a quantitative biosurvey (2mm sieve) is conducted to record the benthos that appear within the square frames (benthos: epifauna, infauna 2mm or larger). In addition, a qualitative biosurvey is conducted to record the benthos that appear around each survey point. 3. Annual Survey Overview: Since the 2008 fiscal year, surveys have been conducted once a year; The survey period is generally set between April and June; In the 2008 fiscal year, trials were conducted at the Akkeshi, Matsukawaura, Banzu tidal flat, Nanki Tanabe, Nakatsu tidal flat, Nagura tidal flat, and Ishigaki Kawahira Bay sites; The Shio River tidal flat survey began in the 2009 fiscal year; As of the 2021 fiscal year, there are 8 sites for the tidal flat survey; Both quantitative and qualitative surveys are conducted; Each site is divided into 1 to 3 areas (A, B, C), and within each area, 2 to 3 survey points are set (upper intertidal zone: U, middle intertidal zone: M, lower intertidal zone: L); At each site, a quantitative survey is conducted to observe changes in biomass, and a qualitative survey is conducted to assess the diversity of species within the site. 4. Number of Benthos Individuals Appearing within the Square Frame and Associated Data (Biological Quantitative Survey (2mm sieve)). At each survey point, five 50 cm square frames are randomly placed to record the epibenthic animals. Then, a 15 cm diameter core sampler (to a depth of 20 cm) is used to collect the organisms along with the sediment. The extracted organisms are then passed through a 2 mm sieve, and the infaunal species are recorded. Epibenthic animals are recorded as the number of individuals appearing within 0.25 m² (50 cm square frame), while infaunal animals are recorded as the number of individuals appearing within 0.0177 m² (15 cm diameter core). Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA.

It was further curated by BioTIME to only include 1 observer per site (randomly selected) as all individuals were recording the same fish at the same time.
DepthElevation: This was recorded as mean depth (ft) per site.
Taxonomy corrections and adjustments: The original data had some species separated by male/female and adult/juvenile; these were aggregated for all species (exceptions follow). There were 3 IDs that grouped multiple juvenile rockfish together; for these, they were changed as follows 'Sebastes atrovirens/carnatus/caurinus/chrysomelas' = 'Sebastes sp1', 'Sebastes chrysomelas/carnatus' = 'Sebastes sp2', and 'Sebastes serranoides/flavidus' = 'Sebastes sp3'; it is important to note that each individual species in the groupings also have observations of confident IDs and so they each have their own records as well as the grouped records. Additionally, there were 2 IDs that didn't have any Linnean scientific names; for these, there were changed as follows - 'baitfish, unidentified' = 'Baitfish sp.' and 'larval fish spp.' = 'Larvalfish sp'. Lastly, some observations were only to family level; for these, Family was populated but Genus and Species were left blank (Bathymasteridae, Cottidae, Embiotocidae, Gobiidae, Ophidiidae, Pholidae, Stichaeidae).

(2007) and Martin et al. (2017), for a total of eight mist netting stations. The first stations on each transect were located on the forest edge, bordering banana plantations and rivers, while subsequent points were located approximately 300 m and 600 m into secondary forest (bordering primary forest). Net rides were cut as near to the individual points as the surrounding terrain would allow and a run of three 12 m long x 2.5 m high Ecotone mist nets was used. Netting occurred between 0600 h and 1100 h to cover the first few hours after sunrise (~ 0630 h), the peak activity period for most Caribbean bird species (Wunderle 1994). Nets were checked at a maximum interval of 30 minutes (Wunderle 1994; Martin et al. 2017). Each station was surveyed twice each year with a minimum of 48 hours between surveys.

Following an initial training week at Base Camp, mist net surveys were completed 6 nights per week and took place at up to four different camps simultaneously. At each camp, narrow (< 1 m wide) trails were cleared in suitable patches of forest to place five 6m long mist nets, each 2.5 meters high, providing a total netting area of 75m2. Two permanent mist netting sites were used per camp, each one as close to the main survey site as possible. Mist netting was conducted between 6:00pm and 12am, giving rise to a netting effort per site per night of 450m2 (6 hours x 75m2). Therefore, the total netting effort for each camp in any given week was 36 hours or 2,700m2. 
The nets were checked every 15 to 20 minutes during the first 3 hours of sampling and every 30 minutes for the last three.

The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 723,000 hectares, but it is attached to two state reserves: Balam-kim and Balam-ku which cover all the length of the west side of the biosphere. The total area covered by the connected reserves is 1,200,000 hectares. Unlike most of the jungles of Yucatan, the jungle of the Calakmul reserve did not serve for timber production, it was also not turned on for the development of agriculture and it is then one of the last pieces of virgin forest in Mexico. The northern parts of Calakmul have Deciduous tropical forests, where trees typically have a canopy of 8-20 meters height and lose their leaves during the dry season (from December to May), but most of the reserve has medium-deciduous tropical trees (Beletsky, 1999) . The tropical jungles medium-deciduous trees have an average canopy of 15-40 meters in height, although most of the trees are 20-30 meters. The canopy can be closed or partially open, and during the dry season, 20% to 30% of trees lose their leaves (Beletsky, 1999). The dominant species in this jungle are: ramon ( Brosimium alicastrum ), chicozapote ( Manilkara zapota ), ceiba ( Ceiba pentandra ), zapotillo ( Pouteria reticulata ), chechen ( Metopium bronwei ) chaca ( Bursera simaruba ), copal ( Protium copal ), tzalam ( Lysiloma bahamensis ) and mahogany or mahogany ( Swietenia microphylla : Ogata et al ., 1999). 
Calakmul also contains many temporary lakes (aguadas) that form during the rainy season and they can last until the dry season. The fauna of Calakmul has jaguars, pumas, ocelots, 
jaguarondis, tapirs, deer, peccaries, howler monkeys and spider monkeys, in addition to 50 species of reptiles and amphibians and 350 resident or migratory bird species. 
To collect data on amphibians, active searching took place on transects (measuring ~2km in lenght) between 9:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. (for studies of daytime species) and between 7:30 p.m. - 11:30 p.m. (for studies of nocturnal species). These searches were made at a fixed width of 5m on both sides of the transect..

Each time a mammal (or indirect signs of a mammal) was found, the time, species, whether the mammal was seen or heard (or whether it was an indirect sign), number of individuals, distance of the mammal perpendicular to the transect and the climatic conditions were recorded.

The 2017 point count locations were very similar to those of 2015 and 2016. Some point counts from 2014 and 2013 were removed in 2015 due to proximity to a point on another transect.

All observations were limited to a 50m radius from the observer.
The time of year and amount of mown grass will affect the numbers and species of birds being recorded. Also as the morning progresses, there is a very noticeable decrease in the amount of bird song and activity. So, points further along a transect tend to have fewer birds.

N 0° 49? 46.74? W in a village garden. All observations made by Chris du Feu.
Two Draza slug monitoring mats (produced and supplied by Bayer) were placed near each other in a shaded grassy part of the garden and remained in the same small area (no more than 2m x 2m) throughout These plastic mats were 45cm square with a reflective grey upper surface and a black lower surface. Between the surfaces was some insulating and moisture absorbent material.
Species nomenclature is according to FSC Field Guide to Slugs of Britain and Ireland, Rowson et al. ISBN 978-1-908819-13-0. Original designations have been amended where appropriate (e.g. Deroceras invadens was recorded originally as Deroceras panormitanum. Note that Arion (Arion) agg. is likely to include both Arion (Arion) rufus and Arion (Arion) ater.  Arion (Carinarion) circumscriptus includes records of both circumscriptus and silvaticus subspecies  treated as one because most individuals have appearance which is not clearly one or the other. Limacus sp. could be either Limacus maculatus, Limacus flavus or hybrids between the two species. The observations were made at a time when Limacus maculatus was stealthily replacing Limacus flavus in the area.
Zero counts are given as blank cells. No species not listed were recorded during the period of the observations although some other species had been recorded occasionally in the garden. These were Arion (Kobeltia) hortensis, Arion (Kobeltia) intermedius, Ambigolimax valentianus, Milax gagates and Tandonia sowerbyi.
There are two consecutive time series
In both cases Inspections were made approximately weekly always by day, and slugs of all species present were counted. The mats were always in the same shady part of the garden
In the first two years, 1999 &amp; 2000, one mat (Fixed) was always replaced exactly in the same place after inspections. The second mat (Moveable) was replaced in a different position. For this mat, a 3x3 grid was defined and in the first week the mat was placed in the centre square. In subsequent weeks it was placed in another of these 9 grid squares. In this way the second mat always remained roughly in the same position but the vegetation below it was able to recover between weeks when the mat was laid on it. (The aim of this was to assess whether the vegetation-free, dry earth below objects which have been in place for a long time was more, or less, attractive to slugs than fresher vegetation. I was surprised that it seems not so but now wonder whether the mat moving process did deter slugs more than dry, vegetation-free earth below the fixed mat.)
In the third year, mats were replaced in the same place after each inspection. For Mat 1, slugs roosting attached to the lower surface and those roosting on the soil below were counted separately. For Mat 2 all slugs were counted, irrespective of roosting position but, after counting all specimens of the pestilential Budapest Slug Tandonia budapestensis were removed and destroyed. The counts were stopped after about a year when the mats disintegrated. The aim of this was to see any preferences in roosting positions  and also to assess the effect of removing individuals of the most pestilential species. [Chris du Feu, 2020] Additional: this study corresponds to the second of two consecutive time series when slugs were monitored with two fixed mats. The first period of the dataset, when a mat was moveable and the other fixed, corresponds to the study: Slug Numbers  Beckingham 1999  2002 (series 1999-2001)","Two ‘Draza’ slug monitoring mats were placed near each other and inspected approximately weekly always by day.

At each camp, narrow (< 1 m wide) trails were cleared in suitable patches of forest to place five 6m long mist nets, each 2.5 meters high, providing a total netting area of 75m2. Two permanent mist netting sites were used per camp, each one as close to the main survey site as possible.

The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 723,000 hectares, but it is attached to two state reserves: Balam-kim and Balam-ku which cover all the length of the west side of the biosphere. The total area covered by the connected reserves is 1,200,000 hectares. Unlike most of the jungles of Yucatan, the jungle of the Calakmul reserve did not serve for timber production, it was also not turned on for the development of agriculture and it is then one of the last pieces of virgin forest in Mexico. The northern parts of Calakmul have Deciduous tropical forests, where trees typically have a canopy of 8-20 meters height and lose their leaves during the dry season (from December to May), but most of the reserve has medium-deciduous tropical trees (Beletsky, 1999) . The tropical jungles medium-deciduous trees have an average canopy of 15-40 meters in height, although most of the trees are 20-30 meters. The canopy can be closed or partially open, and during the dry season, 20% to 30% of trees lose their leaves (Beletsky, 1999). The dominant species in this jungle are: ramon ( Brosimium alicastrum ), chicozapote ( Manilkara zapota ), ceiba ( Ceiba pentandra ), zapotillo ( Pouteria reticulata ), chechen ( Metopium bronwei ) chaca ( Bursera simaruba ), copal ( Protium copal ), tzalam ( Lysiloma bahamensis ) and mahogany or mahogany ( Swietenia microphylla : Ogata et al ., 1999). 
Calakmul also contains many temporary lakes (aguadas) that form during the rainy season and they can last until the dry season. The fauna of Calakmul has jaguars, pumas, ocelots, 
jaguarondis, tapirs, deer, peccaries, howler monkeys and spider monkeys, in addition to 50 species of reptiles and amphibians and 350 resident or migratory bird species. To collect data on reptiles, active searching took place on transects (measuring ~2km in lenght) between 9:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. (for studies of daytime species) and between 7:30 p.m. - 11:30 p.m. (for studies of nocturnal species).
